There were unnecessary conflicts.
 Decisions made too hastily.
 Contracts signed without sufficient reflection.
 Technical solutions implemented before they were mature.
But most often, my speed collided with the slowness of others—not because they were worse or weaker, but simply because everyone has their own pace.
We were four people working on one project. Yuri was an expert in Delphi programming. He helped us understand complex issues. I was a beginner at the time. He showed me how to implement a procedure related to databases and then went to help the other two programmers. I finished quickly and returned to him to ask what was next.
Yuri looked at me and said:
“Wait until the others sort things out. I need to help them too.”
I felt uncomfortable.
**Chapter Three
When Speed Requires Precision**
Another case turned out to be far more dramatic.
I was working with a group of young programmers on a complex project. We were given an assignment, and our employers expected that we would finish this part by September. I pushed the team so hard and accelerated the process so much that we completed it by the end of June.
Formally, it was a success.
 In reality, it was a mistake.
The project turned out to be “ready too early.” We lost both money and the job.
There were other cases as well. One of them involved a project for a government organization. I completed my part in six months. But there was no overall concept of what was supposed to be created—not even in the minds of the department leaders for whom I was working. The project simply was not mature.
As a result, my part had to be completely redone several times. A lot of wasted time. A lot of unnecessary work. And no additional compensation.
I was fast.
 But I still had to learn how to be precise.
In order not to burden others with my haste and speed, I began working on several projects at once. Life, in general, does not allow one to focus on only a single task—it requires distributing attention across all areas of life. Of course, every task has its own time, and I learned that as well. This is exactly where precision is needed, and the ability to bring things to completion.
