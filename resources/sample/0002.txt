The Future We Agreed On
**Chapter One
Quiet Mornings**
I often think that a successful life does not always look like a celebration.
Sometimes it looks like a quiet morning, when the house is still half asleep, the light outside is soft, and the world seems to pause—just long enough for you to notice it. I often wake up early—at five, sometimes at six in the morning. At such moments, I sit at the kitchen table with a cup of tea—strong, black, sometimes with milk—and allow myself not only to remember, but also to dream and imagine: both about the past and about the future.
I love tea.
 It teaches patience.
 It reminds me that some things cannot be rushed without losing their essence.
My name is Rostislav. I am a computer engineer—by education and by temperament. My profession is systems engineer. I graduated from the Polytechnic Institute in Chișinău, specializing in computing systems, at a time when we were taught not only how to use machines, but how to understand them. We were taught to think in systems, to see structure beneath chaos, to imagine the result before touching reality. We were taught that a human controls the machine, not the other way around.
At the time, I did not yet understand how universal this principle was, or how far beyond my profession it could be applied. Later, it became my way of life.
**Chapter Two
Youth, Speed, and the Cost of Impulsiveness**
In my youth, I was impulsive. Psychologists would probably call me a choleric.
I wanted everything at once: knowledge, success, recognition, experiences. I read a lot—greedily, chaotically. I wanted to be everywhere, to know everything, to keep up with everything. By the age of thirty, I had read around ten thousand technical journals and several hundred works of fiction.
I wanted to play football, play table tennis, dance, read technical journals and bring what I read to life, while also reading literature and watching films. I dreamed that I had many bodies, and that I could be in all these places at once, doing all these things simultaneously. I have a very good memory—perhaps because I read so much.
It felt like a race, although I never fully understood who I was competing with.
At that time, I believed speed was an advantage.
 That belief cost me dearly more than once.
